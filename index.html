<p>I am coming back to school to learn UX Design. Last semester I also took a class in programming and learned the basics of Python. I already have a degree in Marketing from Texas State University.</p>

<p>In my spare time I like to ride bikes, read, play video games, and climb at Austin Bouldering Project. I currently work at the Apple Store Barton Creek as a Mac technician. I have a love for technology and want to learn more skills and meet new people that will help me grow in this sector.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Things</h2>

<h3>My Favorite Movie</h3>

<p>My favorite movie is <b><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></b>, starring <b>Keir Dullea</b> I love science fiction, and this is one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made. The visual effects, music, and themes are so impactful. So many movies have taken direct inspiration from it. The traditional visual effects still hold up remarkably well today, in the age of computer graphics used for visual effects.</p>

	<li>Ratatouille</li>
	<li>Ramen</li>
